All pins 

Pins have been rotated because of rotating PCB.
STM was rotated because there was some issues earlier with the PCB which was resolved.

Drive (Steering STM)
We used smart elex for FR because MD10C fried up.

Power pins:  
FL  -  D2_2
FR -  D2_1
BL  -  D1_3
BR -  D1_1

Data cables
FL  -  FLW_2 PC15,PA0
FR -  FRW_2  PB9,PB8
BL  -  BLW_2 PA5,PA6
BR -  BRW_2 PB15,PB14

Encoder

Based on closeness
FL - FRW_2 PB9,PB8
FR - BRW_2 PB15,PB14
BL - FLW_2 PC15,PA0
BR - BLW_2 PA5,PA6









Manipulator (Drive STM)

Power pins
Connect to nearby manipulator power ports (All the power cables are named and length of wires has been chosen accordingly)



Data cables  (DIR,PWM)
M1 - ENC_BLW1, BLW1 (two pin connector, GND of three pin connector ) PA7,PB0  ,GND of BLW1
M2 - MRW1 - PB5 , PB4
M3 - MLW1 - PA1,PA2
M4 - BRW1 - PB15,PB14
M5 - FLW1 - PC15,PA0
M6 - FRW1 - PB9,PB8



STEERING (Manipulator STM)

Data cables
FL  -  L5 PB9,PB8
FR -  L2  PA1,PA2
BL  -  L3 PA5,PA6
BR -  L1  PC15,PA0

SCIENCE  (Drive STM)

LA - M2(MRW1)
MOTOR1 -M4 (BRW1)
MOTOR2 -M5 (FLW1)
STEPPER - M3 (MLW1)
